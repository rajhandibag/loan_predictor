Loan Approval Prediction System 🏦💳
This project predicts whether a loan application should be approved or rejected using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models. The system is deployed with Streamlit for an interactive and user-friendly interface.


📌 Key Features
✅ End-to-end ML/DL pipeline (data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building)
✅ Real-time loan approval predictions
✅ Multiple algorithms tested (ML classifiers + Neural Networks)
✅ Streamlit web app deployment
✅ Practical application in the finance/loan approval process
